# 100 Years of Plane Crashes
As a travel enthusiast, recently disheartened with all the plane crashes I heard of on the news, I wanted to understand the history of plane crashes and if it is still one of the safer modes of travel.
The data set we got was from the years 1908 to 2009. This data set contained the information about 5268 plane crashes and 13 data points per crash.
I found the data sets on Opendata and used python library Pandas to clean them up and make them useable. The python notebook is available in this repository.

### Some of the questions I had going into this were:
1. What was the most unsafe flights based on: 
  • Operators
  • Planetypes
2. What were some of the reasons for plane crashes?
3. Where did the most plane crashes occur?
4. What decade had the most number of casualties?
5. What percentage of total passengers who travelled died as a result of a plane crashes? (1970 to 2008)

##### What did I learn?
1. Based on number of crashes and fatalities, Aeroflot, a Russian passenger plane carrier, had the most number of crashes at 179 and over 7000 fatalities. A close second was the US airforce with 176 crashes and close to half the number of fatalities.

2. From the data set we calculated that 83.5% of the fatalities in plane crashes happened on passenger airlines.

3. The most unsafe plane type was douglas which amounted for close to 1000 plane crashes. A little bit of frther research revealed that one of the common issues faced by the plane was the cargo hatch opening midair due to the pressure difference causing the plane to disscent and eventually crash.

4. Among companies that make airplanes Boeing was the most common carrier which meant that the most number of people abaord were on Boeing planes. The data also showed that the most number of fatalities accounted for were also on Boeing planes 

5. Most common reasons for plane crashes according to the information found in the dataset (taken from the final conversation with air traffic control), remain mostly unknown. Weather, faulty take off and landing and machine issues account for 43.5% of the crashes.

6. Most of the plane crashes were seen to occur in Moscow, Russia and Sao Paulo, Brazil

7. Though the number of plane crashes occuring, saw a steady increase from the early 1900s to the early 2000s, it is imortant to note that with advancements in technology and an improvement in the global economy more people had money to travel leading to more flights than before and therefore a higher chance of plane crashes. 

8. There were 815 plane crashes from 1970 to 1980, the most recorded in a single decade. This steadily reduced after the 1980s to reach 507 plane crashes from 2000 to 2010.

9. As technology advanced, there were more survivors in plane crashes than before. This can be visualized by drawing a map for total number of passengers abord flights that crashed and the total numer that were reported dead.
